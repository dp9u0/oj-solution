# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

## Description

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

## Example

```javascript
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
```

## Solution

TODO: 可以考虑使用DP或者备忘录缓存已经计算过的字符串
