* Hard (44.25%)
* Testcase Example:  '[100,4,200,1,3,2]'

```md
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
Example:
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

## Solution

`[3,4,6,7]:[2,2,2,2]`

输入 `5`

`[3,4,5,6,7]:[5,2,5,2,5]`
