```md
Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

```

## Solution
