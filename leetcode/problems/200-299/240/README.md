Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a target value in an m x nÂ integer matrix. The matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false

Constraints:
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 300
-10^9 <= matix[i][j] <= 10^9
All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9

```
