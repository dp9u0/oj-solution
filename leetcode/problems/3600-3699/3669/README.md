```md
Given two integers n and k, split the number n into exactly k positive integers such that the product of these integers is equal to n.
Return any one split in which the maximum difference between any two numbers is minimized. You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: n = 100, k = 2
Output: [10,10]
Explanation:
The split [10, 10] yields 10 * 10 = 100 and a max-min difference of 0, which is minimal.

Example 2:

Input: n = 44, k = 3
Output: [2,2,11]
Explanation:

Split [1, 1, 44] yields a difference of 43
Split [1, 2, 22] yields a difference of 21
Split [1, 4, 11] yields a difference of 10
Split [2, 2, 11] yields a difference of 9

Therefore, [2, 2, 11] is the optimal split with the smallest difference 9.


Constraints:

4 <= n <= 105
2 <= k <= 5
k is strictly less than the total number of positive divisors of n.


```

## 中文翻译

给定 n 和 k，将 n 分成恰好 k 个正整数使其乘积为 n，且最大值与最小值之差最小。返回任意一组最优分解。

## 解题思路

DFS 分解：枚举 n 的因子来分解。由于 k <= 5，递归搜索所有 k-因子分解，在所有合法分解中选取最大值与最小值之差最小的方案。为保证因子有序避免重复，按非递减顺序枚举因子。
