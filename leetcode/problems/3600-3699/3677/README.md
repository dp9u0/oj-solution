```md
You are given a non-negative integer n.
A non-negative integer is called binary-palindromic if its binary representation (written without leading zeros) reads the same forward and backward.
Return the number of integers k such that 0 <= k <= n and the binary representation of k is a palindrome.
Note: The number 0 is considered binary-palindromic, and its representation is '0'.

Example 1:

Input: n = 9
Output: 6
Explanation:
The integers k in the range [0, 9] whose binary representations are palindromes are:

0 &rarr; '0'
1 &rarr; '1'
3 &rarr; '11'
5 &rarr; '101'
7 &rarr; '111'
9 &rarr; '1001'

All other values in [0, 9] have non-palindromic binary forms. Therefore, the count is 6.

Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 1
Explanation:
Since '0' is a palindrome, the count is 1.


Constraints:

0 <= n <= 1015
