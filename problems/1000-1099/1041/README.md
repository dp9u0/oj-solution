```md
On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:

The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.

The robot can receive one of three instructions:

'G': go straight 1 unit.
'L': turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
'R': turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).

The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

Example 1:

Input: instructions = 'GGLLGG'
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
'L': turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
'L': turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
Based on that, we return true.

Example 2:

Input: instructions = 'GG'
Output: false
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.
Based on that, we return false.

Example 3:

Input: instructions = 'GL'
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
'L': turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.
'G': move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.
'L': turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.
'G': move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.
'L': turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.
'G': move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.
'L': turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).
Based on that, we return true.


Constraints:

1 <= instructions.length <= 100
instructions[i] is &#39;G&#39;, &#39;L&#39; or, &#39;R&#39;.


```

## 翻译

机器人从原点出发面朝北，按指令序列无限循环执行（G 前进、L 左转、R 右转）。判断机器人是否始终在某个圆内。

## Approach

执行一轮指令后，若回到原点则一定有界；若方向改变（不朝北），经过最多 4 轮会回到原点；若位置偏移且仍朝北则无界。故只需判断一轮后 (x,y)==(0,0) 或方向非北。
