Given an integer array instructions, you are asked to create a sorted array from the elements in instructions. You start with an empty container nums. For each element from left to right in instructions, insert it into nums. The cost of each insertion is the minimum of the following:

The number of elements currently in nums that are strictly less than instructions[i].
The number of elements currently in nums that are strictly greater than instructions[i].

For example, if inserting element 3 into nums = [1,2,3,5], the cost of insertion is min(2, 1) (elements 1 and 2 are less than 3, element 5 is greater than 3) and nums will become [1,2,3,3,5].
Return the total cost to insert all elements from instructions into nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7

Example 1:

Input: instructions = [1,5,6,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Begin with nums = [].
Insert 1 with cost min(0, 0) = 0, now nums = [1].
Insert 5 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,5].
Insert 6 with cost min(2, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,5,6].
Insert 2 with cost min(1, 2) = 1, now nums = [1,2,5,6].
The total cost is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: instructions = [1,2,3,6,5,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Begin with nums = [].
Insert 1 with cost min(0, 0) = 0, now nums = [1].
Insert 2 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,2].
Insert 3 with cost min(2, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,2,3].
Insert 6 with cost min(3, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,2,3,6].
Insert 5 with cost min(3, 1) = 1, now nums = [1,2,3,5,6].
Insert 4 with cost min(3, 2) = 2, now nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
The total cost is 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.

Example 3:

Input: instructions = [1,3,3,3,2,4,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: Begin with nums = [].
Insert 1 with cost min(0, 0) = 0, now nums = [1].
Insert 3 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,3].
Insert 3 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,3,3].
Insert 3 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,3,3,3].
Insert 2 with cost min(1, 3) = 1, now nums = [1,2,3,3,3].
Insert 4 with cost min(5, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,2,3,3,3,4].
​​​​​​​Insert 2 with cost min(1, 4) = 1, now nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4].
​​​​​​​Insert 1 with cost min(0, 6) = 0, now nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4].
​​​​​​​Insert 2 with cost min(2, 4) = 2, now nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4].
The total cost is 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 4.


Constraints:

1 <= instructions.length <= 105
1 <= instructions[i] <= 105


```

## 题目翻译

给定 instructions 数组，从空数组开始逐个插入元素到有序位置。每次插入代价 = min(已有中小于该值的个数, 已有中大于该值的个数)。返回总代价 mod 10^9+7。

## 解题思路

**树状数组（BIT）**

维护值域频率的 BIT。对每个元素 x：
- less = query(x-1)（严格小于 x 的个数）
- greater = 已插入总数 - query(x)（严格大于 x 的个数）
- 代价 = min(less, greater)
- update(x, 1)

值域 ≤ 10^5，BIT 大小 O(10^5)。总 O(n log V)。
