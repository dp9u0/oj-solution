```md
In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.

The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.
Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

Example 1:


Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.

Example 2:


Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.

Example 3:


Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105

## 题目翻译

在一个长度为 n（n 为偶数）的链表中，第 i 个节点（0-indexed）被称为第 (n-1-i) 个节点的"孪生节点"。

孪生和（twin sum）定义为一个节点与其孪生节点的值之和。给定一个偶数长度链表的头节点，返回链表中最大的孪生和。

## Approach

利用快慢指针找到链表中点，同时用栈记录前半部分的值。然后遍历后半部分，依次与栈顶元素（即前半部分对应位置的值）求和，取最大值。

也可以直接将链表转为数组再双指针，但栈方法空间更优。

时间复杂度 O(n)，空间复杂度 O(n)。
