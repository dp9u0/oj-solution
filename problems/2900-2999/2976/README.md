You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].
You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.
Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].

Example 1:

Input: source = 'abcd', target = 'acbe', original = ['a','b','c','c','e','d'], changed = ['b','c','b','e','b','e'], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
Output: 28
Explanation: To convert the string 'abcd' to string 'acbe':
- Change value at index 1 from &#39;b&#39; to &#39;c&#39; at a cost of 5.
- Change value at index 2 from &#39;c&#39; to &#39;e&#39; at a cost of 1.
- Change value at index 2 from &#39;e&#39; to &#39;b&#39; at a cost of 2.
- Change value at index 3 from &#39;d&#39; to &#39;e&#39; at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

Example 2:

Input: source = 'aaaa', target = 'bbbb', original = ['a','c'], changed = ['c','b'], cost = [1,2]
Output: 12
Explanation: To change the character &#39;a&#39; to &#39;b&#39; change the character &#39;a&#39; to &#39;c&#39; at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character &#39;c&#39; to &#39;b&#39; at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of &#39;a&#39; to &#39;b&#39;, a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.

Example 3:

Input: source = 'abcd', target = 'abce', original = ['a'], changed = ['e'], cost = [10000]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from &#39;d&#39; to &#39;e&#39;.


Constraints:

1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105
source, target consist of lowercase English letters.
1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000
original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.
1 <= cost[i] <= 106
original[i] != changed[i]


```

## 翻译

给定source和target字符串，以及original→changed的转换代价。可将source中任意字符通过多次转换变为另一个字符。求将source转为target的最小总代价，不可能则返回-1。

## 解题思路

建26个字符的有向图，边权为转换代价。用Floyd-Warshall求所有点对最短路。对source和target每个不同位置，累加最短路代价。
