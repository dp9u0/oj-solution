```md
There is a 1-indexed 8 x 8 chessboard containing 3 pieces.
You are given 6 integers a, b, c, d, e, and f where:

(a, b) denotes the position of the white rook.
(c, d) denotes the position of the white bishop.
(e, f) denotes the position of the black queen.

Given that you can only move the white pieces, return the minimum number of moves required to capture the black queen.
Note that:

Rooks can move any number of squares either vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
Bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
A rook or a bishop can capture the queen if it is located in a square that they can move to.
The queen does not move.


Example 1:


Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 8, d = 8, e = 2, f = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can capture the black queen in two moves by moving the white rook to (1, 3) then to (2, 3).
It is impossible to capture the black queen in less than two moves since it is not being attacked by any of the pieces at the beginning.

Example 2:


Input: a = 5, b = 3, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5, f = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can capture the black queen in a single move by doing one of the following:
- Move the white rook to (5, 2).
- Move the white bishop to (5, 2).


Constraints:

1 <= a, b, c, d, e, f <= 8
No two pieces are on the same square.

## 中文翻译

8x8 棋盘上有三个棋子：白车在 (a,b)，白象在 (c,d)，黑后在 (e,f)。只能移动白棋，求最少多少步能吃掉黑后。车走直线不能跳子，象走斜线不能跳子。

## 解题思路

答案最多为 2（车总能两步内到达后的位置）。检查是否能 1 步完成：
1. 车直接吃后：同行或同列，且象不在中间阻挡
2. 象直接吃后：同对角线，且车不在中间阻挡

都不满足则答案为 2。
